/***
 * The purpose of this test is to ensure that the like / unlike system for the radio stations are working.
 * We will first be testing whether the Radio Station object's like attribute has memory.
 * Then we will be testing whether the likeStation function interacts properly with the objects in changing attributes.
 * Following, we will be testing the pathway from RadioStationUI to liking the RadioStation object.
 * Finally, we will be testing whether the RadioStation objects are being saved properly.
